## Charity Donation & Management App
# Inspiration
As we know, the pandemic has been tough on a lot of people. According to the International Labour Organization, the coronavirus crisis is having a devastating effect on employment worldwide, with more than one billion workers at risk of a pay cut or losing their jobs. Charities are losing their donors, thus seeing plummeting revenue and disruptions to their services. Some families struggle to meet their basic needs such as food, clothing, and even a mask but are unable to receive help from any sources. More than 4 in 10 households face serious financial problems amid this pandemic. On the other end of the spectrum, we have some potential donors who are either clueless about how and where they can help, or maybe they are shy about the fact that they can only afford little.

We thought, why not make the donation process easier so that one can donate as little as a dollar, any moment they want, within just a few clicks. We all love using apps that make our life easier on a day to day basis, and that's what we did with donations. We made an app with some pre-registered charities. Anyone can enter the app and donate some pre-built care packages (a care-package contains some necessary items specific individuals need daily) or any amount of money they want within seconds.

We have two distinct target audiences: One that needs help and one that is willing to help.

# What it does
Our app makes the donation process more manageable by having some pre-researched data and pre-built functionalities.

Donors can register and have a "Donor Profile"; Charities can register and have a "Charity Profile." Donors will have two options: donating money directly and sending pre-built care packages. Charities will have an option in their app to see the list of donations and donors' details.

Our efforts to make the process easier include researching and making a list of care packages donors can choose from. We currently have four care-packages:

- Corona Help Package
- Grocery
